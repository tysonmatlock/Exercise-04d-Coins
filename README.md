# Project 04â€“2D Platformer
Project for MSCH-C220 132Mar2025

## How To Play

A 2D platformer. Use A and D to move left and right. Press space to jump. Stomp on enemies and collect as many coins as you can! Reach the flag to proceed to the next level. 

## Implementation
Sound effects created in ChipTone (https://sfbgames.itch.io/chiptone)

Music recorded in Logic Pro X (https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/)

In addition to the required elements of this project, I added the following for additional points:
* Added multiple levels
* Added large/elaborate level
* Added parallax background
* Added music
* Polished the overall feel of the game by tweaking player settings
* Added ability to wall-jump
